# Ao: An eye tracking platform for babies

## Introduction

This is the project part of Google Summer of Code 2022 - Eye tracking project for neonates. It's a collaboration between (at the moment) the two main students of the project Ioannis Valasakis (@wizofe) and Mohammed Selim (@Mu-selim) under the mentoring of Arvind Chandna, MD DO FRCS FRCophth and Suresh Krishna, PhD.

Ao is the personification of light in MƒÅori mythology and it sounds like a suitable name for the project (under discussion).
