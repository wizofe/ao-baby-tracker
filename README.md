# Ao Eye tracking for babies

## Introduction

This is the project part of Google Summer of Code 2022 - Eye tracking project for neonates. It's a collaboration between (at the moment) the two main students of the project Ioannis Valasakis (@wizofe) and Mohammed Selim (@Mu-selim).

Ao is the personification of light in Māori mythology and it sounds like a suitable name for the project (under discussion).
